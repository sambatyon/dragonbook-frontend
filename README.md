# Dragon Book Front End in Different Languages

The front end of the dragon book is one of my favorite pieces of code.
A middle size project, it is perfect to learn new programming languages.

I have used this approach for years, but I have sadly lost many of my
implementations, so with bazel which allows to use a single build system for
multiple projects, I am slowly collecting my implementations here, together
with a half updated version of the original one.
